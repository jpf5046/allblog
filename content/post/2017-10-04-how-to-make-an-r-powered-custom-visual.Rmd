## Power BI Custom Visuals

This is a walkthrough on creating custom visuals for Power BI, specifically, R powered custom Visuals. The end product will be similar to the custom visuals found [here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/powerbi-desktop-r-powered-custom-visuals/).  

By the end of this tutorial we will have the following Plotly Scatter 3D chart--fully interactive in Power BI as a custom visual. 

```{r, echo= FALSE}
p <- plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~hp, z = ~qsec, color = ~cyl, colors = c('#BF382A', '#0C4B8E')) %>%
  add_markers() %>%
  layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = 'Weight'),
                     yaxis = list(title = 'Gross horsepower'),
                     zaxis = list(title = '1/4 mile time')))

p

```


There are five steps to creating custom visuals in Power BI. This guide will cover all of them. Here is the list of steps:


1. Download and Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Generate a pre-Packaged visual with node.js 
3. Edit packaged visual in a Rstudio
4. Complie Visual in cmd line 
5. Import into Power BI 

### Step One, Installing node.js

Easiest part. Use the link above.






### Step Two, Create a Pre Packaged Visual with node.js

1. Open command line and type in the following: `pbiviz new Rpoweredcustomvisual - t rhtml`
      + `Rpoweredcustomvisual` can be anything the user wants to name the visual
2. Then type `cd Rpoweredcustomvisual`
3. Then type `npm i powerbi-visuals-utils-dataviewutils` 
4. Then type `pbiviz start` 

There you go, your command line should look like this:

__Before we move to step 3__ 
Let's look at what we created in step 2. 

1. Go to your User folder, open the User folder you are using
2. Look for a file named `RpoweredCustomvisual` 
      + ...or whatever was decided to name the visual
3. Open the folder 

It should look exactly like this:

  \center ![](pictures/What the Packaged R Visual Looks like.PNG) \center








### Step Three, Edit the folder we created in Step Two

Edit the R script found in the file created in Step Two. 

![](pictures/Rscipt location.PNG)

We open up the Rscript and see the following code:

![](pictures/What the R Script Looks Like before.PNG)

__Then we make our R code changes__ 

Let's copy and paste our plotly code: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}

p <- Values %>%
  plot_ly( x = ~wt, y = ~hp, z = ~qsec, color = ~cyl, colors = c('#BF382A', '#0C4B8E')) %>%
  add_markers() %>%
  layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = 'Weight'),
                      yaxis = list(title = 'Gross horsepower'),
                      zaxis = list(title = '1/4 mile time')));

internalSaveWidget(p, 'out.html');

```

We see the new R code in our Rscript file now. Now we overwrite this new R script and save in our `Rpoweredcustomvisual` folder.

After saving the file, we made all the changes neccessary. Let's package the visual and bring it into Power BI. 







### Step Four, Package the Visual

1. Go back to your command line an type `pbiviz package` -- you might have to type `ctrl+c` to terminate listening

2. Go to the same file you created in step two, there is going to be a new folder

  ![](pictures/new fodler created after PACKAGE step.PNG)

This is your news packaged Power BI custom visual, this is the file you choose in step five. 







### Step Five, Bring into Power BI


1. Import Custom Visual 

![](pictures/Import custom Visual Power BI.PNG)

2. Go to the `Rpoweredcustomvisual` folder created in step two, delect the `dist` folder 

![](pictures/CustomVisual in folder.PNG)

3. Select your visual

4. Create data -- make sure column names are the same as the R code

![](pictures\random data for visual.PNG)

5. Put the custom visual on the Power BI canvas 

6. Drag and drop the data fields into the visual.

7. Your final visual should look like this:
